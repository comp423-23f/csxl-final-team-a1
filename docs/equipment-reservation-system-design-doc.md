## Overview

The equipment reservation station is a resource for students to have access to a system for reserving and borrowing various tech equipment such as AR/VR Headsets, iPads, iPhones, Androids, Keyboards, and Arduinos. This will enable learning and development opportunities for students who might not have had access to more expensive items such as AR/VR headsets, or have never had the chance to utilize a different platform like iPad, iPhone, Android. An online system running through the CSXL will make borrowing equipment convenient with multi-day reservations and the ability to view equipment availability.
